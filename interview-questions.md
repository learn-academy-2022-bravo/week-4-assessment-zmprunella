1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Can't quite remember what props are. I know they have something to do with class and components. I would have to do a litte more research on how they connect to the rest.

  Researched answer: Similar to functions in JS, props are arguments passed into react compononets. Read only components. Pass data between components. 



2. What is a DOM event? 

  Your answer: Would have to do a bit more research on DOM. I know that it has to do with React.

  Researched answer: A DOM event in JS allows registration of different event handelers in a doccument. User interactions in the browser; clicks the mouse, web pages loaded, image loaded, mouse moves, input feild is changed, html form is submitted, pressing a key



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Not entirely sure what OOP is or how it compares to functional programming. WOuld need to look up a bit more on that.

  Researched answer: OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data and objects rather than logic or functions. Functional programming cannot store data in objects, it can only transform it.

  OOP- data can be stored in objects and behvior, funtional - behavior.

  Floats have decimal places. integers do not.

  In JS they are just numbers, together. 

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Compared to JS it does not need a return to return the function. It implicitly does the return.
